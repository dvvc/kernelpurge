# Kernelpurge

A simple utility to clean old Linux kernels when your /boot partition gets
full. It's aimed at Debian-like distributions, and only tested in Ubuntu.

# How to run

Just copy [kernelpurge.sh](https://github.com/dvvc/kernelpurge/blob/master/kernelpurge.sh)
and execute as a regular user.

# Gotchas

Only tested in Ubuntu 16.04. The script is quite verbose and will ask before
doing anything potentially dangerous, however run at your own risk!
